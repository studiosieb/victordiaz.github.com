The fictitious itinerary of a person living in "Poblenou area, Barcelona":http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=112009115463063919948.00047d611994066867781&z=16. 
Our persona suffers from Dissociative Personality disorder. There are days she is a girl working in a fruit shop delivering fruit to the neighboring companies and days he is a man with a hazy past.
Their only way to communicate is through pictures they take in their everyday tour, which are here superimposed in the order they were taken by each personality.

You can find the pictures alone in the flickr account of "Marian":http://www.flickr.com/photos/46638554@N02/ and "James":http//www.flickr.com/photos/kiwi_popeye/.
