p(meta). 19 May 2009 - Scalextricity 

Scalextricity is an augmentation of the original game Scalectrix, a slot car racing game. The car is tracked using a ps3 camera along the circuit extracting location and speed information which are used to sonify the car and modify the video coming from a wireless camera located on top of the car.
