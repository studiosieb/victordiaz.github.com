p(meta). 19 May 2009 - Flower power 

<!-- In todays world we do not discover new realities, we create them through virtuality therefore the gap between virtuality and reality get smaller and smaller 

	The simulations of reality replace the real and this simulacrum is hyper reality.

    Characteristics:
       - The loss of the materiality of objects (virtual realities)
       - The explosion of new media technologies 
	  - Hyperreality connects to performance and must be studied as 
	    being reproduced among wide scale audiences (art, websitesâ€¦)


    The traditional activity of art has been the representation of reality - manipulating materials to create tangible mirrors of our experience and desire. Now with the mechanisms of the new digital technologies, the artwork can become itself a simulation of reality - an immaterial digital structure encompassing synthetic spaces which we can literally enter.
