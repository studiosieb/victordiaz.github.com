p(meta). 19 May 2009 - Flower power 

In today's world the chances "to discover" new realities is being reduced so we started to create fictional ones. We create those realities through virtuality therefore the gap with the real world is getting smaller and smaller. It looks a bit scary when said so why not make it funny transforming you into a dancing flower?
