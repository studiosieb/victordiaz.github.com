Synesthesia is a really interesting neuronal condition, where different sensations are mixed together and thus some people see colors while listening to sounds or have a different taste while seeing various things. 
We wanted to re-create this experience based on a song that we like. Thus, we choose a song and depending on it's lyrics, there is a re-creation of the song with images generating at the same time cover of the album the song belongs to, made out of these images.
