p(meta). 19 May 2009 - Lumivi 

Lumivi is consisted of a game designed in order to research the effects of stress on performance levels in immersive environments. In this game the subjects had to play following a white tile on the floor of the eXperience Induction Machine (XIM) room as it changed its direction of movement as fastest as possible. The gameplay had to be done under normal and stressing conditions such as color and sound factors.

The hypothesis of the researchers that performance level increases when subjects were exposed 
to stress, failed to be accepted, because the study could not find any difference in performance of 
the subjects with or without stress factors applied. The study discovered, however, that there is a 
strong correlation between performance scores under stress and the affinity to play sports that 
require intense physical activity.
