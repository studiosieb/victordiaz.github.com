Lighthamar is an interactive light installation made for the <a href="http://www.dreamhamar.org/">Dreamhamar</a> participation network led by <a href="http://www.ecosistemaurbano.com/">Ecosistema Urbano</a> to redesign the Stortorger Square in Hamar, Norway.

The installation consisted in a grid of helium inflated balloons with ultra bright LEDs inside controlled by a computerized system that allows multiple interactions and working modes that can be changed at any moment.

Here a list of different features that we made: 

	* Light patterns that change according the environmental sound in the square
	* Color change according to weather forecast
	* touch inputs in a phone screen
	* direct smsing and emailing to different balloons containing the blinking pattern
