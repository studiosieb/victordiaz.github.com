The overall goal of this project goal was to implement a set of computer software that could monitor a fleet of vehicles. 
Each client can work in two modes: active, sending information to the server constantly and passive, sending information by petition. One of the multiples features of the system is that the server not only works as a merely database since it could generate notifications and alert privileged users about anomalies in the routes that the vehicles had to perform.
