Sketchy plane is a game where you take the role of a paper airplane or better to say the wind that makes it move! So we can just say that we become something similar to a God of wind :)

The aim is to control the paper airplane trying to avoid the birds that come from the top of the screen using something different than a keyboard or a mouse. So why not playing with the air? :)
