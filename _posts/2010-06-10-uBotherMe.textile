On this hack, we wanted the user of Android to loose control of an alarm clock app. So, the alarm clock is controlled trough a webpage, where the user can put the link to a music on a website to be loaded to android, or also you can set a message and it will be generated using the canoris api. Also it is possible to put a link from soundcloud and set it as alarm.
