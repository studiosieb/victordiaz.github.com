The hypothesis of the researchers that performance level increases when subjects were exposed 
to stress, failed to be accepted, because the study could not find any difference in performance of 
the subjects with or without stress factors applied. The study discovered, however, that there is a 
strong correlation between performance scores under stress and the affinity to play sports that 
require intense physical activity.
