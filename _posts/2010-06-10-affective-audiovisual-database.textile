p(meta). 19 May 2009 - Physiology-based control of affective audio-visual database 

The study of my master thesis was about studying human emotions and create a biofeedback system that varies the affective state of the user using audiovisual stimuli and at the same time modulate the content being showed. 

This biofeeback system could be used in the following scenarios: 

Personal cinema
Treatment for disorders such as chronic pain, depression, etc 
Interactive installations 
Narrative modulation in films 
Relaxing device
