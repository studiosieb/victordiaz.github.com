h1. {{ page.title }} 

We are using the a 15x10 meters media facade at Medialab Prado, Madrid. 

Topic: Several environmental dangers are threatening human life: Buildings, pollution, cars. They are eating all the public space around and our mission is to draw clean spaces with the help of a bright light: A torch or our mobile phone light. 

In this first prototype we only have one level with a lot of evil monster representing the city aggressions. If the monster extinguish all the free space, we die and have to start again.
