The overall goal of this project goal was to implement a set of computer software that could monitor a fleet of vehicles. 

Each client can work in two modes: active, sending information to the server constantly and passive, sending information by petition. One of the multiples features of the system is that the server not only works as a merely database since it could generate notifications and alert privileged users about anomalies in the routes that the vehicles had to perform. 

The system was designed using a small pc connected to a GPS and a phone which used GPRS a data connection to exchange data information encapsulated in SOAP messages with a remote server.

The server was made using PHP using the Apache web server which at the same triggered different scripts asynchronously in order to process the incoming data. 
A web application was created in order to monitor the fleet and perform actions over the system.
