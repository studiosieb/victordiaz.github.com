Thanks to the guys of Open Design City I had the opportunity to experiment with laser cutters. First I started using some simple generative designs and experiment a bit exporting data from Processing to something that could be understood by the laser cutter. Then I realized it could be cool to extract silhouettes from pictures and print them. 

So I ended up creating something similar to a photo both app that takes pictures of people, analizes it and after having some pictures taken send them to the laser cutter. Here you can see some results!
