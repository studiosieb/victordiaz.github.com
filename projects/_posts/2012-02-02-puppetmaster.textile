The puppet master is a game that creates a link between the people in a public space and a user behind a computer. 
It works pretty similar to the Mechanical Turk, one of the first "automatas" ever created. It gives the illusion of a intelligent machine that interacts with the people which is in reality a person behind manipulating the computer. 
The software provides lots of interaction modes to play with the people, funny, engaging and unlimited in possibilities.
