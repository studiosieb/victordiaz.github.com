Sketchy plane is a game where you take the role of a paper airplane or better to say the wind that makes it move! So we can just say that we become something similar to a God of wind :) The aim is to control the paper airplane trying to avoid the birds that come from the top of the screen using something different than a keyboard or a mouse. So why not playing with the air? :) 

This experimental game is an exploration of new ways of interaction and gaming that goes beyond the traditional forms where everything is controlled with our top limbs.

The game was made using OpenFrameworks for the graphics and Pure Data to generate the sounds, interfacing with Arduino and creating the mapping. Pure Data was used to control all the world parameters, the main reason to use this tool to modify the parameters was due to the amazing and sometimes forgotten capabilities of live coding and creating quick interfaces. Once the graphics layer was made, all the logic of the game was prototyped with Pure Data, so no need to delay the creation processing waiting to compile the project.
