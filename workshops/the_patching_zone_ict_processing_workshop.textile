The workshop aimed to teach the students how to create low and high fidelity representation of a final product through sketching and prototyping. The number of participants were 11 students in MBO high school from The Netherlands with an IT profile. All of them have some programming knowledge more oriented into backend programming and lacking sense of design and visual communication. The workshop lasted 5 hours a day during two days, so a total of 10 hours although the worked a bit more outside the workshop time to present the final result.

The workshop was framed in Augmented Reality. The reason chosen was that AR is a quite new technology not enough explored in non-research / high-tech environments, so it was a strong motivational point for the students to work with. 

The first day, the students were not allowed to use any computer, most of them get distracted when they are in front of one of them so it was a clear decision not to use them since the first day were not a requirement. Some of them felt disappointed with the decision. 

The first hour and a half, the students got a sense of what sketching, low and high fidelity prototyping and storyboard is. Some videos were showcased with examples of prototypes made by other people and in an open conversation we tried to find the benefits of using prototyping in the workflow. All the students were invited to talk at any point of the presentation and discuss.

After this first introduction, the students were given a task were they had to design an interface for an industrial context using paper prototyping and sketches. The teamed in pairs and the were working for 45 minutes on the task. The only requirements they had were 5 features that the interface had to have but they were not said if the interface had to be digital or analog. During this time a countdown timer was set up and they were forced to take a picture for documentation every beep they heard each 5 minutes.  

The 5 lowfi prototypes had different results. Some groups were somehow biased since they  work only with computers and made pure phone/tablet aplications. Some others sketched industrial panels and though carefully about the security it might imply. The took the pictures as expected although some times they took them randomly. 

After an hour lunch break the students were given a one-hour introduction to Augmented Reality. This introduction showed the state of art of the technology and multiple references to scifi movies were this concept has been used multiple times. 

A second assignment was given to the students. They had to sketch and create an idea of an AR application no matter how would be implemented or if the technology was ready or not, about one proposed subject. Six subjects were proposed to the 5 teams and they spent another 45 minutes thinking and sketching the idea. They had to document the process as well but this time without any timer that notify them. 

The second day the students had to create a high fidelity Augmented Reality prototype using Android as a platform. They were given two already prepared software tools to help them with the prototype. First an Android application that shows the camera view and overlays HTML5 on top of it. Secondly a Python script that creates a http server. It monitors all file changes in a directory allowing having almost real-time content refresh in the mobile phone while editing the HTML5 files in the computer. 

Prior to this day they were sent some instructions on how to install python and some libraries in their computers.

As the students come from a technical background, we though it would be interesting for them to teach them some design aspects that could improve their designs. No improvement in design aspects were seen after this introduction, so a new way for showing them design is required. 

They set up all the required software and showing them how to work with the given code bits. 
Later they were teamed in pairs in order to brain storm and later lowfi sketch about the applications they wanted to create. Some of them needed a bit of boost. They though they did not have any ideas. They were given an exercise to write down whatever though they had in mind and build on those. At the end they turned having one of the best ideas of the group. 
During the rest of the day they were prototyping using the giving tools. Most of them did not have Android powered devices so we lend some of them during the day.

The students were called one day later for bringing their results with the final prototype to have a review. Some of them did not finished for that they but all of them worked on them. 

For evaluating the prototype they were asked to fill out a form with some information about it. The questions were simple and most all of them asked in a really simple way. The part were they had to put their storyboards was quite poorly done. 

Finally we met another day to do some video documentation about the apps, only 3 of them were recorded. The reason was to award those who work harder and motive the others to improve their work for the forthcoming workshops.
