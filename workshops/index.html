This workshop had a dual purpose, first and the clearest was to introduce Processing language to the ICT students. They already have a programming background, so no basic programming introduction, logic and code structure was needed to explain. On the other hand in a previous survey previous to the workshop, none of the students had any previous knowledge of graphics programming and experience using this programming tool / language. </p>
<p>
After the introduction they got a random computer screen overlay with different holes and shapes that they had to use to create the final project. The reasons behind using those overlays was firstly to engage them creatively. Thinking out of the comfort zone that implies working with a squared screen and different shapes trigger many useful thoughts. Secondly, to let them think individually since all the overlays were different.

The workshop aimed to teach the students how to create low and high fidelity representation of a final product through sketching and prototyping. The number of participants were 11 students in MBO high school from The Netherlands with an IT profile. All of them have some programming knowledge more oriented into backend programming and lacking sense of design and visual communication. The workshop lasted 5 hours a day during two days, so a total of 10 hours although the worked a bit more outside the workshop time to present the final result.
 </p>
<p>

The workshop was framed in Augmented Reality. The reason chosen was that AR is a quite new technology not enough explored in non-research / high-tech environments, so it was a strong motivational point for the students to work with.
