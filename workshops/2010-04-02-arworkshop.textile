Results 





The workshop aimed to teach the students how to create low and high fidelity representation of a final product through sketching and prototyping. The number of participants were 11 students in MBO high school from The Netherlands with an IT profile. All of them have some programming knowledge more oriented into backend programming and lacking sense of design and visual communication. The workshop lasted 5 hours a day during two days, so a total of 10 hours although the worked a bit more outside the workshop time to present the final result.

The workshop was framed in Augmented Reality. The reason chosen was that AR is a quite new technology not enough explored in non-research / high-tech environments, so it was a strong motivational point for the students to work with. 

The first day, the students were not allowed to use any computer, most of them get distracted when they are in front of one of them so it was a clear decision not to use them since the first day were not a requirement. Some of them felt disappointed with the decision. 

The first hour and a half, the students got a sense of what sketching, low and high fidelity prototyping and storyboard is. Some videos were showcased with examples of prototypes made by other people and in an open conversation we tried to find the benefits of using prototyping in the workflow. All the students were invited to talk at any point of the presentation and discuss. 

After this first introduction, the students were given a task were they had to design an interface for an industrial context using paper prototyping and sketches. The teamed in pairs and the were working for 45 minutes on the task. The only requirements they had were 5 features that the interface had to have but they were not said if the interface had to be digital or analog. During this time a countdown timer was set up and they were forced to take a picture for documentation every beep they heard each 5 minutes.  

The 5 lowfi prototypes had different results. Some groups were somehow biased since they  work only with computers and made pure phone/tablet aplications. Some others sketched industrial panels and though carefully about the security it might imply. The took the pictures as expected although some times they took them randomly. 

After an hour lunch break the students were given a one-hour introduction to Augmented Reality. This introduction showed the state of art of the technology and multiple references to scifi movies were this concept has been used multiple times. 

A second assignment was given to the students. They had to sketch and create an idea of an AR application no matter how would be implemented or if the technology was ready or not, about one proposed subject. Six subjects were proposed to the 5 teams and they spent another 45 minutes thinking and sketching the idea. They had to document the process as well but this time without any timer that notify them. 

The second day......
