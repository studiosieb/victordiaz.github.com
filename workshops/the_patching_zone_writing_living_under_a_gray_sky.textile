The sky over Rotterdam (Living under a gray sky)

Ok, I have to admit it. I need lots of sun. I grew up in a southern Mediterranean country with 95% of the year sunny or almost sunny days. The sun powers life, gives you energy, good vibes, put a smile in almost everybody's faces and provides you vitamin D. I've lived in many countries already with more or less sun, but frankly Rotterdam ranks the top one in lack of sun. It's easy to have a full month non-stop the sky covered with clouds.

I've been always pasionated with the sky, it is such a inmense, etheral thing. Something that is everywhere, that is almost impossible to avoid, but at the same time so distant and ungraspable. 
Few years ago, I started to document the very first moment of the day where I could see the sky taking a picture of it. I made it with a dual purpose, first to see color variations of the sky accross time and as a way of introspecting myself and try to find out how light and weather affected my mood. 
So here I have a sample of 20 consecutive days in Spain during winter, mostly sunny, mostly happy mood. 

This year was quite difficult for me in that sense.

How dutch people do it? For me is still a mistery. I've tried to carefully observe daily lifes of people and apparently they do quite similar to me! 


But as I said to a loved friend of mine, if Netherlands had good weather it would be a too perfect place too live.
