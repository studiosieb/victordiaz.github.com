Creativity. Is not only about you, is the context!
It's all about context! 

"I am not creative. I wasn't born with that talent." I've heard that sentences hundred times in my life. People who are not trained in arts or any creative field which basically means a huge percentage of the world tend to believe that creativity is something that you need to be born with, a God given quality, a gift. For sure, genes might help you to be in the creative side but honestly context is the most important factor to engage the right side of your brain. 
When I refer about context, I don't only mention a place 

"yo soy yo y mi circustancia"
