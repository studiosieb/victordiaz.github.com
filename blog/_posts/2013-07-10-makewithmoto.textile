A month ago I joined an awesome project in <a href="http://www.motorola.com">Motorola - (a Google Company)</a>, called <a href="http://www.makewithmoto.com">Make With Moto</a>. A summer tour, with a van wrapped in velcro, 3d printers, lasers, zillion tools and hackable phones. 

So far the experience has been great, lots of travelling, inspiration, workshops, awesome people around and food, loads of food! Travelling around the US making and hacking it's like a dream job! :)
