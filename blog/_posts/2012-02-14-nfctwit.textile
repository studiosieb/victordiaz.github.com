I created a small working prototype of tangible twitting. I made some cards to be placed in different places and when I tap them using my phone I could automatically twitt where am I 

The magic behind is pretty easy, in fact there is no magic, is just NFC. My phone, a Nexus S, has a NFC reader that I used to scan the tags that were placed behind the cards. Each tag has a different id number that is linked to the placename.bsite that you can find here:
