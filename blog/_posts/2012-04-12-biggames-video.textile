As I commented in the previous post I was teaching with my friend <a href="http://sergio.eclectico.net">Sergio Gal√°n</a> <a href="http://www.uncoded.es/biggames">BigGames</a> a workshop in the Medialab Prado in Madrid about game creation for large screens or Media Facades. So well here is the cool video summary created by <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/lara.cano">Lara Cano</a>


{% if site.videos == true %} 

<div class="videoWrapper">

</div>

<video  width="100%" height="360"  src="../videosparaweb/olebot_-_the_flamenco_robodancer_640x360.MP4" poster="../videosparaweb/olebot_-_the_flamenco_robodancer_640x360.jpg" controls="controls" preload="none">
        It seems that your browser doesn't support html5 videos!! 
</video>
{% endif %} 

I have to say that I was really impressed by the participants and the results of the workshop. The nice people of the Medialab Prado will allow the participants to have their projects as a part of the Medialab Prado mediafacade content! Congrats to all!
