My friend / flatmate / kibu researcher mate Loes and I did a series of pictures almost a month a ago just for fun. We reused them to play a bit using the mobile phone’s screen to create a funny visual composition 

The process is quite similar as I did for the Experiment 1 but in this case, rather than colors I put the pictures in the phone’s sdcard and display them when the OSC message arrive to the phone indicating which picture to load.

To see how it looked like check the video!
