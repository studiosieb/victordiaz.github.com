Using OSC (UDP) messages, I can set from a computer the screen color of any of the phones individually or simultaneously creating nice effects and patterns.

The main application is created in processing and runs on a normal computer. It is in charge of sending messages to each phone with an application running that will receive the r, g, b colors selected in the main computer and then displayed on the phoneâ€™s screen.
