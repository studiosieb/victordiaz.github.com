			<h1> IQR Modules </h1>
			<p> 
				When creating Olebot, I developed a couple of handy modules for IQR, the first an UDP module that allows to communicate group of neurons from the exterior and the second, a module that load txt files as the states of the group of neurons. 
			</p>
			<p>	
				Be careful since both modules are in "one-night-hack" mode since I created them to fit an specific purpose.
